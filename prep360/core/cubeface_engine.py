# Program: AM_ImageAndMask_to_cubemap_v4.py
# Authors: Mike Heath (@LaunchedPix) and Alex Gee (@Macgregor)
# (and AI (chatgpt & google AI & Anthropic Claude Code & OpenAI Codex) - Hey give credit where its due.)
# Date: 4/28/2026
#
# Disclaimer: We really have NO assurance that this program is correct.  !USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
# Purpose:
#
# This software performs a pinhole decomposition of wide angle fisheye lens/camera images.
#
# At this point it is specifically written to process fisheye images that have lens
# parameters defined in Agisoft Metashape. In fact it processes images by reading in a
# camera calibration file that was exported from Agisoft Metashape. A word of caution is due.
# Do not just look at an Agisoft Metashape lens calibration file, study it and see the names
# of the lens parameters and find similar parameter names used by another structure from motion
# software derived lens calibration and substitute those in for the Agisoft Metashape parameters
# with the same name. This will not work! The mathematical equation implemented in other sfm software
# are not the same as those used in Agisoft Metashape.
#
# This command line summarizes what the program needs to run it. NOTE: The amlenscal is
# the lens calibration for one fisheye lens. The directories of images and (optionally) masks
# need to each have the images and masks from just one lens. Thus, to process imagery
# from one 360 camera, you will need to run this code twice.
#
# usage: AM_ImageAndMask_to_cubemap_v4_nocache.py [-h] [--outputdir OUTPUTDIR] [--amlenscal AMLENSCAL] [--lenslabel LENSLABEL] [--directoryfisheyeimages DIRECTORYFISHEYEIMAGES] [--directoryfisheyemasks DIRECTORYFISHEYEMASKS]
#                                        [--lensonlymask LENSONLYMASK] [--maxusefulfov MAXUSEFULFOV] [--facewidth FACEWIDTH] [--rigstructure] [--version] [--h] [--usage] [--outputformat {png,tiff,jpg}] [--force]
#
# You can run the code in several ways with different combinations of inputs.
#
# You will alsoways need to supply --amlenscal
#
# You will always need to supply --directoryfisheyeimages
#
# You will always need to supply --lenslabel
#
# You will always need to supply --facewidth
#
# You will always need to supply --outputdir
#
# You can optionally supply different combinations of --directoryfisheyemasks , --lensonlymask and --maxusefulfov.
#
# I'd say the beseline use of the code is to supply the --directoryfisheyemasks which is a directory containing a
# mask for every fisheye image (.png format where 0 idicates not to use the corresponding fisheye image pixel and 255
# indicates to use it).
#
# A "fallback" option is to provide --lensonlymask which is a single .png mask. This will be used for every image
# that does not have a mask. So if you supply a --directoryfisheyemasks and some fisheye image is missing a mask, then
# the --lensonlymask will be used for that fisheye image. If you didn't supply a --directoryfisheyemasks then the
# --lensonlymask will be used for every image.
#
# A second "fallback" option is to use --maxusefulfov in place of --lensonlymask . This option essentially
# creates a mask in place of the --lensonlymask by creating it from the lens field of view. This is a little more risky
# option for the user because if the --maxusefulfov value is chosen too large, there can be issues doing the pinhole
# splits because the mathematics of the lens model falls apart beyond a certain field of view.
#
# The parameter --rigstructure is optional and simply organizes the output directories in a different structure
# that makes it easier to use a rig in Metashape Pro. Without this option being specified, the default behavior
# of the program structures the ouput directories in a format that makes it easy to use "camera stations" in Metashhape
# standard edition to put a constraint on the alignment so each pinhole image split from the same fisheye image
# shares the same aligned position (nodal point).
#
# It takes a fairly sizable abount of time to compute the remapping for each cube face for each lens.
# Once those five remapping functions are computed (maybe up to two minutes each), the
# application of remapping all of the fisheye images and masks though each of the five
# remapping functions is pretty quick per image (~4.5 sec for me), though with a lot
# images, it can still take a while.
#
# Note: I specifically use Agisoft Metashape format (and mathematics behind it) lens
# calibration data in this code. I convert the data to ray directions from the nodal point
# as a preprocessing to remove the lens distortions and the projection. Then I reproject these
# rays to faces of a cube.
#
# My goal here was to set up a universal (ray directions) framework to work within that is "convenient"
# regarding cameras and camera calibrations. In my understanding, there are many different
# conventions for storing camera calibrations that may be inconsistent with eachother (Open_CV,
# Reality Scan etc). It is inconvenient to work with a camera model with distortion parameters
# because the process of determining the effective "ray direction" for each pixel is
# dependent on the mathematics frameworks used by each different SFM software. My desire to transform
# to ray directions was to isolate theis step up front. One day someone might write this
# ray direction conversion to work for Reality Scan or other SFM software packages.
#
# Here I've tried, and I hope it works, to compute the solid angle of each pixel in an image
# and the ray direction (as a quaternion). This is just another format to store and represent
# the image intrinsics.
#
# The parameterization I've used here is based on my (and heavily on AI's) understanding of
# the conventions used in Agisoft Metashape and how to transform a calibration to this new
# format.
#
# It will be POSSIBLE to convert lens calibrations in other conventions to this format too
# such as those from Reality Scan though I have not done that yet.
#
# It seems to me that working with quaternions SHOULD be convenient for transforming these
# camera ray directions using the extrinsics for an "aligned" set of images.
#
# My first use of this program will be to look at conversions from equisolid "dual-fisheye"
# 360 camera images into pinhole images for subsequent alignment in Metashape.
#
# I have also implemented (but not tested) converting wide field of view equidistant
# fisheye images into pinhole splits. Those can be run with the current code. The results
# have not been validated though.
#
# When you run the code, a bonusdata directory will be output with some images that convey
# information to the user. One item in this directory is a raw file that contains the
# solid angle and ray direction image
# (such as SolidAngleRayDirQuaternionwxyz_BandSequential_FLOAT_3840x3840x5.raw).
#
# This is a headerless float32 image that contains:
#
#   First: Solid angle in steradians
#   Next: the Quaternions (four images (w,x,y,z)).
#
# One can use whatever program one desires to view/inspect the output images.
#
# One option is ImageJ (which can be found on-line and downloaded for free).
#
# If you use this you can File->Import->RAW  (imput Width, Height, Images=5, little endian on a windows PC)
#
# You then need to scale the image to view it (its float32). You can do analysis such as line
# profiles etc.
#
# Other files in the bonusdata directory include visualizations of the ray directions and masks.
#
# Good luck!
#
# And remember that:              !USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

    # Here we go through each of the five faces and determine the reprojection.
    #
    # The approach we want to take is the following.
    #
    # We want to go through each of the five faces, and for each determine the remapping which
    # is basically how to compute the image or image mask values for each pixel in the cube face
    # image.
    #
    # We will go through every pixel coordinate in the input (say fisheye image) image and project this
    # pixel to a cube face. For each pixel this is a ray from the nodal point of the lens
    # (center of focus) through the input image pixel, going in the direction that the light
    # came from that was recorded in this pixel in the image. Where this ray hits a cube face is
    # where we want to project this image pixel (or mask) to. It might miss and thats fine. If it
    # hits, we want to store the real valued (floating point) coordinates of where it hits the
    # cube face. Along with those real valued intersection coordinates, we want to store the
    # integer valued pixel coordinates of the input image pixel that projects to this intersection
    # point. These can kind of be thought of as our tie points for the reprojection. We store
    # these intersection points because they will be useful for processing the color image and
    # the segementation mask. Of course, what we really want isn't these real valued cube face
    # intersection points, what we want is the image and mask values at the integer valued pixels
    # locations in the cube face. This will require a RESAMPLING.
    #
    # So for any integer valued pixel location in the cube face image or mask we are creating,
    # we need to essentially look around that pixels location to find nearby image locations
    # where these ray intersections occurred. Then we need to determine how to mix (some weighted sum)
    # the pixel values from the input image that correspond to these intersection points to determine
    # the cube face color image or mask pixel value for this pixel.
    #
    # There are many different algorithms to resample an image. They differ in their computational
    # effort/cost and the image quality one can achieve with it. We want to use an algorithm that
    # yeilds a high image quality (even if it runs slowly). A key here to making this workable is
    # to recognize that every image captured from one lens has the same resampling needed for
    # one cube face (well each of the five). Therefore we want to compute the "receipe" once and then
    # use it repeatedly to compute one cube face for each image captured with a lens. This receipe
    # is specific for each cube face image (or mask) and essitially identifies which pixels in
    # the image to sum (after multiplying each by a weight value) to combine them to create the output
    # pixel value.
    #
    # We want to compute the remapping once and then apply it later, over and over, without
    # needing to compute the way to do the remapping over and over again.
    #
    ############################################################################################
    # So, lets start by going through each of the five faces and creating a list of data for the
    # rays that hit this cube face. We will record the fisheye image coordinates and the
    # cube face intersection coordinates. Because really wide fisheye lens images have a lot
    # of "useless pixels" that are outside of the useful image area, we want to exclude using
    # rays that are "cast" through these "invalid" pixels. For the moment, for simplicity, I am
    # assimuming a maximum angle from the optical axis to simply threshold and determine which
    # pixels to use, and which to discard. Later this decision could be made by examining the
    # mask images, or come other method. Its not a problem to work to a better solution at this
    # point in time.
